Most websites have a copyright in the footer, like Â©2015. However, if you do this using static text, you'll need to be sure to update this annually. Wouldn't it be nice to automate this process?

With [Token Filter](https://www.drupal.org/project/token_filter) you can easily achieve this. Below are the steps to make it happen.

1. Download and enable [Token Filter](https://www.drupal.org/project/token_filter) and [Token](https://www.drupal.org/project/token).

2. Select a text format or formats that you wish to apply Token Filter to. Select **Replace tokens**. This can be found under **admin/config/content/formats**

3. Now add a block under **admin/structure/block/add**. Make sure the text format is set to the format or formats you edited in step 2. You can now use [tokens](https://www.drupal.org/node/390482) to dynamically update the year, or add your site's name.
