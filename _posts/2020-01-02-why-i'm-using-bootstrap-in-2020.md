I recently needed to redevelop our [agency's website](https://shields.design/). We moved from [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) in an effort to keep things simple. However, we didn't end up changing the design much. The original design was totally custom, which meant it was up to me to create a typography system, layout system, as well as style any and all elements and components that could exist. As a web developer I'm used to this, but often overlook the complexity and redundancy involved in making the same decisions over and over again. Because of this, I decided to reach for [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), which has matured a lot in this newest release. Below are several reasons why I will continue to use Bootstrap in 2020.

## Utility Classes and Variable Overrides

I had convinced myself that Bootstrap was not able to be customized enough to create a unique design. In the past, that might have been true, but thanks to [utilities](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/extend/approach/#utilities) and [variable overrides](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/getting-started/theming/#variable-defaults) I was able to recreate a custom theme without breaking away from the framework.

For context, below are screenshots of some of the more complicated layouts.

Below is all the custom css I needed to write, in addition to the variable overrides.

### My Custom CSS

```scss
.carousel**container .carousel {
  max-width: 788px;
}
.carousel**container {
  background: rgba($secondary, 0.25);
}
.grid img {
  @extend .img-fluid;
}
main {
  h1,
  h2,
  h3,
  h4,
  h5,
  h6 {
    @extend .text-base;
    @extend .text-secondary;
  }
}
.full-width {
  width: 100vw;
  position: relative;
  left: 50%;
  right: 50%;
  margin-left: -50vw;
  margin-right: -50vw;
}

.reveal-item {
  .reveal-item__title-wrapper {
    @include media-breakpoint-up(md) {
      z-index: 2;
      transform: translateY(-100%);
      transition: all 0.15s cubic-bezier(0.075, 0.82, 0.165, 1);
      position: absolute;
      display: flex;
      flex-direction: column;
      align-items: center;
      justify-content: center;
      top: 0;
      right: 0;
      bottom: 0;
      left: 0;
    }

    h1,
    h2,
    h3,
    h4,
    h5,
    h6 {
      font-family: $font-family-base;
      text-transform: uppercase;
    }
  }

  &:hover,
  &:active,
  &:focus {
    text-decoration: none;
    .reveal-item**title-wrapper {
      @extend .bg-info;
      @include media-breakpoint-up(md) {
        transform: translateY(0);
        transition: all 0.15s cubic-bezier(0.075, 0.82, 0.165, 1);
      }
    }
  }
  .reveal-item**image {
    @include media-breakpoint-up(md) {
      position: absolute;
      top: 0;
      left: 0;
      right: 0;
      z-index: 1;
    }
  }
}

.image-ratio {
  height: 0;
}
.image-ratio--square {
  padding-top: 100%;
}
.image-ratio--rectangle {
  padding-top: 75%;
}
.image-ratio--narrow-rectangle {
  padding-top: 25%;
}

.text-base {
  font-family: $font-family-base;
}
.hero__content {
  background: rgba($white, 0.5);
}
main img {
  @extend .img-fluid;
}
.latest-post {
  min-height: 480px;
}
.navigation__link {
  font-family: $headings-font-family;

  &:hover,
  &:active,
  &:focus,
  &.navigation__link--active {
    text-decoration: none;

    &:after {
      content: "";
      display: block;
      height: 25px;
      width: 50px;
      position: absolute;
      background: url("/assets/img/shared/gear-half-green.svg") top center
        no-repeat;
      left: 50%;
      margin-left: -25px;
      top: 41px;
    }
  }
}
.testimonials**carousel {
  min-height: 480px;
}
.testimonials**gear {
  opacity: 0.05;
}
.testimonials**gear-1,
.testimonials**gear-3 {
  animation: spin * * clockwise 8s linear infinite;
  bottom: -25%;
}
.testimonials**gear-2 {
  animation: spin__counter-clockwise8slinearinfinite;
  top: -25%;
}

@keyframes spin**clockwise {
  100% {
    transform: rotate(360deg);
  }
}
@keyframes spin**counter-clockwise {
  100% {
    transform: rotate(-360deg);
  }
}
```

### My Variable Overrides

```scss
// Override Custom Variables From _sass/bootstrap/_variables.scss

// Color system
$blue: #3881b1;
$red: #b91e5e;
$orange: #e06625;
$yellow: #e7b721;
$green: #6a973f;
$teal: #18847c;
$gray-900: #212529;

$secondary: $orange;
$info: $teal;

// Breadcrumbs
$breadcrumb-bg: transparent;
$breadcrumb-divider-color: $gray-900;
$breadcrumb-active-color: $gray-900;

// Options
$enable-responsive-font-sizes: true;
$enable-rounded: false;
$breadcrumb-divider: quote("Â»");

// Typography
$headings-font-family: "Anton", sans-serif;
```

In my opinion, I was able to develop a very unique design that does not resemble the stereotypical cookie cutter Bootstrap look and feel. By simply changing the color and font variables and leveraging utility classes, I was able to design the majority of the site. If I needed even greater flexibility, I just added my own styles, which only amounted to an extra ~155 lines of `.scss`.

## Typography System

Consistent and hierarchial typography is core to every website, yet often overlooked. Creating a maintainable and consistent typography system is no small feat, and is easy to get wrong. Fortunately Bootstrap ships with an excellent [typography](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/content/typography/) system. What I really appreciate is that there is a setting which allows for [responsive font sizes](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/content/typography/#responsive-font-sizes), which allows text to scale more naturally across device and viewport sizes. Finally, if the default settings don't meet your needs, you can just override [default typography variables](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/v4.4.0/scss/_variables.scss#L276).

## Accessibility and Consistency

Accessibility is more than just adding alt descriptions to images and using semantic markup. There is a lot to get wrong, especially when trying to build common features such as tabs and modals. I used to let my ego get the best of me, and thought that using a framework to do this was **lazy**. Now I realize it's smart, if not the only appropriate thing to do. Components like [dropdowns](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/components/dropdowns/), [collapse](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/components/collapse/), and [modals](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/components/modal/) are battle tested. Not only are they guaranteed to be accessible, but they're also guaranteed to work consistently across all [supported browsers](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/getting-started/browsers-devices/#supported-browsers) and [mobile devices](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/getting-started/browsers-devices/#mobile-devices).

## Styles All Elements

Most designs I receive don't account for all HTML elements. For example, imagine you're building a WordPress site and hand it off to the client. The client creates a new page and adds a `<table>` and a `<blockquote>`. If you weren't using Bootstrap, you would have had to create styles for these elements even though they were never explicitly given to you in a design. It might seem trivial, but this has burned me in the past. Along with styling all elements, Bootstrap also consistently styles common elements you would need to style anyways, like [buttons](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/components/buttons/) and [forms](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/components/forms/).

## Ships With Features You Might Need Later

One of the challenges with web development is that it's impossible to account for anything and everything upfront. The first iteration of a website may not need to have a [carousel](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/components/carousel/) or [tooltips](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/components/tooltips/), but these features might need to be added later. It's a heck of a lot easier to have them tucked away rather than have to roll them out from scratch.

## Performance

Bootstrap has a reputation for being bloated. However, if you use their [cdn](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/getting-started/download/#bootstrapcdn) you can dramatically reduce the file size. I'm hosting our site on Netlify, and am using their asset optimization.

This reduced my CSS into a single 30.0 KB file, and my JS into a single 51.5 KB file. When I run my site against [web.dev](https://web.dev/) I score pretty well.

## tl;dr

The newest version of Bootstrap is highly customizable and scalable. It's battle tested, accessible, and is a solved problem for most websites.
